# OpenCV Insights üì∏

Welcome to OpenCV Insights! This repository contains various examples demonstrating the usage of OpenCV for computer vision tasks. Each example is located in its own folder within the repository.

## Introduction ‚ÑπÔ∏è

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a wide range of functionalities for image and video processing, including object detection, tracking, augmented reality, and more.

This repository contains examples that showcase different features and capabilities of OpenCV, providing practical demonstrations for various computer vision tasks.

## Examples üöÄ

1. **Augmented Reality:** Final version of an augmented reality example.
2. **Background Subtraction Approach:** Basic motion detection with built-in background subtraction.
3. **Feature Detection:** Example demonstrating feature detection with bounding patterns.
4. **Find Game:** Example demonstrating the usage of OpenCV to find objects in a game scenario.
5. **Motion Detector:** Basic motion detection and tracking example.
6. **Multi-Object Tracking based on Color:** Example demonstrating multi-object tracking based on color.
7. **Pedestrian Detection:** Example utilizing a detector based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor for pedestrian detection.

Each example is contained within its respective folder and includes relevant code, data, and documentation.
